# MILAN — City & Keyword SEO Expansion (White-Hat)

**Date:** 2026-07-04 · **Domain:** https://milanlife.in · **By:** for Nitesh Pandey

This expansion was done the **safe, Google-compliant way** — NOT mass city
doorway pages (which trigger Google's Scaled Content / Doorway Abuse penalties
and cost sites 30–60% traffic in the 2026 updates). Two things were added:

1. **Non-branded keyword aliases** → extra entry URLs that consolidate onto your
   existing rich pages via canonical. Zero duplicate-content risk.
2. **8 metro landing pages** → each with *genuinely unique* local content
   (local language, city ecosystem, city-specific FAQ). Defensible under
   Google's rule: "programmatic pages are fine if each delivers unique value."

Everything self-validates: `node --check server.js` passes; all JSON-LD valid.

## 1) New metro pages (unique content, self-canonical)

URL pattern: `/decentralized-social-media/{city}` (hierarchical, no "milan" in slug)

| # | URL | City | Local language | Canonical |
|---|-----|------|----------------|-----------|
| 1 | https://milanlife.in/decentralized-social-media/mumbai | Mumbai | Marathi | self |
| 2 | https://milanlife.in/decentralized-social-media/delhi | Delhi | Hindi | self |
| 3 | https://milanlife.in/decentralized-social-media/bengaluru | Bengaluru | Kannada | self |
| 4 | https://milanlife.in/decentralized-social-media/hyderabad | Hyderabad | Telugu | self |
| 5 | https://milanlife.in/decentralized-social-media/chennai | Chennai | Tamil | self |
| 6 | https://milanlife.in/decentralized-social-media/kolkata | Kolkata | Bengali | self |
| 7 | https://milanlife.in/decentralized-social-media/pune | Pune | Marathi | self |
| 8 | https://milanlife.in/decentralized-social-media/jaipur | Jaipur | Hindi | self |

Each page has: unique title + description + keywords, city geo meta, OG/Twitter
cards, BreadcrumbList + WebPage(areaServed=City) + FAQPage JSON-LD, a native-
language block, and unique city-specific copy. Files: `frontend/city/*.html`.

**Do NOT clone these for 800 more cities.** 8 genuinely-different metros = fine.
800 templated clones = doorway penalty. If you expand later, each new city needs
its own real local content (local data, testimonials, regional context).

## 2) New non-branded keyword aliases (map to existing pages)

All added to `server.js`. Each serves an existing rich page whose canonical
points to the primary URL — so link signals consolidate, no thin pages created.

## 3) Sitemap changes

- New file: `frontend/sitemap-cities.xml` (the 8 metro URLs).
- `sitemap-index.xml` now references it (auto-generated in server.js).
- `robots.txt` now lists `Sitemap: .../sitemap-cities.xml` too.

Submit in GSC → Sitemaps: `sitemap-cities.xml` (or just re-submit
`sitemap-index.xml`, which now includes it).

## 4) IMPORTANT — deploy note

Your repo has **three copies** of the app tree:
`milan-app/` (source), `milan-release/milan-app/`, and a nested
`MILAN_V7_2_PREMIUM_UPDATED/milan-app/`. These edits were applied to the
**source `milan-app/`** only. Re-run your release packaging
(`package-release.mjs` / `redeploy.sh`) to propagate into the release build
before deploying, so the live server picks up the new routes and files.

## 5) After deploy — verify

1. Open each metro URL in a browser → confirms 200 + unique content.
2. Google Rich Results Test on 1–2 city URLs → FAQ + Breadcrumb valid.
3. GSC → URL Inspection → Request Indexing for the 8 city URLs (spread over
   ~1 day, ~10-12/day limit).
4. GSC → Sitemaps → submit `sitemap-cities.xml`.
5. Watch Page Indexing: metros should index; if any get "Duplicate / alternate
   canonical", their content isn't unique enough — add more local detail.
