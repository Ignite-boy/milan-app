## Overview

MILAN is a modern social platform designed around a simple principle:

> **One User = One DID = One Isolated DWN Space**

The application combines a polished social experience with an ownership-oriented data model. Identity is DID-based, user profile data is persisted through the production DWN node, and Mini-DWN uses PostgreSQL for durable record storage.

### Production

- **Web:** https://milanlife.in
- **DWN node:** https://dwn.milanlife.in
- **DWN health:** `GET /health`
- **DWN protocol gateway:** `POST /json-rpc`

## Core Architecture

```

The application keeps the authoritative profile record on the production DWN node rather than depending solely on browser-local state. This includes profile pictures: upload, read-back, logout, and login restore all use the persisted DWN record path.

## Identity & Data Ownership

MILAN is built around DID-based identity and isolated user storage.

- One registered user receives one DID-backed identity.
- Profile records are addressed using the user's DID.
- Profile media is stored as a DWN record and read back from the DWN node.
- Access control supports private, public, and DID-based sharing models.
- The architecture is designed so storage infrastructure can evolve without rewriting the frontend permission model.

### Profile picture persistence

Profile pictures are stored as a dedicated DWN record:

```text
profile-picture:<user DID>
```

The live profile flow is:

```text
Upload
  ↓
MILAN API
  ↓
Mini-DWN JSON-RPC
  ↓
PostgreSQL-backed DWN storage
  ↓
Read after logout/login
  ↓
Profile restored
```

## Product Surface

MILAN includes a social product layer with:

- Home, public, friends, and personal feeds
- Profile editing and persistent avatars
- DID-based people discovery and friend requests
- Reactions, comments, notifications, and messaging
- Image, video, and text publishing
- Privacy modes for private, public, and shared-DID content
- Media upload and streaming workflows
- Dark-mode friendly premium UI with motion and interaction polish

## Engagement & Experience Layer

The current product also includes an extended engagement system covering:

- Animated profile/avatar treatments
- Gradient and motion-based UI accents
- XP and level progression
- Daily streaks and milestone rewards
- Badge and leaderboard concepts
- Smart composer/AI interaction chips
- Live activity indicators
- Haptic feedback on supported devices

These features are designed as product-layer enhancements on top of the identity and data architecture rather than as replacements for it.

## Local Development

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

Local application endpoint:

```text
http://localhost:5000
```

### Local Mini-DWN

```bash
cd mini-dwn
sudo docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Verify the node:

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:3000/health
```

Expected shape:

```json
{
  "database": true,
  "ok": true,
  "service": "mini-dwn",
  "storage": "postgresql"
}
```

### Local JSON-RPC

Mini-DWN exposes the DWN protocol gateway at:

```text
POST http://localhost:3000/json-rpc
```

## Production Deployment

The production application is deployed on Vercel, while the authoritative Mini-DWN node is exposed through the production DWN endpoint.

Production environment configuration should use:

```text
MINI_DWN_ENDPOINT=https://dwn.milanlife.in
```

Verify the production node before testing profile persistence:

```bash
curl -sS https://dwn.milanlife.in/health
```

And verify the protocol endpoint:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST https://dwn.milanlife.in/json-rpc \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"dwn.processMessage","params":{"target":"did:milan:test","message":{"descriptor":{"interface":"Records","method":"Query"},"authorization":{"payload":"e30","signatures":[]}}}}'
```

## Security & Reliability Principles

MILAN's infrastructure is built with a few non-negotiable principles:

1. **Persist before trusting the UI.** Client-side cache is treated as convenience, not authoritative storage.
2. **DID-scoped records.** User-owned records are addressed and isolated by DID.
3. **HTTPS in production.** Production services communicate over the public HTTPS DWN endpoint.
4. **Resilient upstream calls.** Transient Mini-DWN failures such as rate limiting or gateway errors should be handled with bounded retry/backoff rather than immediately surfacing as permanent profile failures.
5. **Stable fixes stay stable.** Changes should be narrowly scoped and should preserve already-verified functionality.

## Quick Verification Checklist

After a production deployment:

```text
[ ] https://milanlife.in loads
[ ] https://dwn.milanlife.in/health returns 200
[ ] /json-rpc returns JSON
[ ] Login succeeds with a fresh token
[ ] Profile read returns avatarRecordId when a DP exists
[ ] DP upload succeeds
[ ] Logout succeeds
[ ] Login restores the persisted DP
```

## Roadmap

MILAN is structured to continue evolving across three layers:

- **Product:** better discovery, communication, creation, and engagement
- **Identity:** stronger DID lifecycle and user-controlled permissions
- **Infrastructure:** more resilient DWN hosting, observability, backups, and scalable isolated storage
