# MILAN V7 — Update Notes

This build addresses six requested updates. Summary of what changed and how to finish setup.

## 1. Sober premium UI (replaces the loud / "dhinchak" look)
- New authoritative stylesheet: `frontend/milan-premium-sober.css`, loaded **last** in both
  `frontend/index.html` and `frontend/app.html` so it wins the cascade.
- Calms the competing theme layers (Krishna saffron→magenta→cyan, V2/V3 confetti & neon, V4, premium-ui)
  into one restrained indigo-blue accent on a deep ink background.
- Removes: spinning conic ring, marigold pulse, aurora/float animations, grain/noise overlay,
  rainbow login gradients, confetti canvas and the auto welcome-reward popup.
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

No JavaScript logic was changed for the UI — only presentation is overridden, so all existing
behavior (login, feed, upload, AI panel) keeps working.

## 2. GEO / AI-engine SEO (founder: Nitesh Pandey)
- `frontend/llms.txt` — the file AI engines read for site understanding (served at `/llms.txt`).
- `GET /ai-info` (+ `/ai-info.json`) — machine-readable brand + founder JSON.
- `index.html` JSON-LD now includes `Organization.founder`, a standalone `Person` (Nitesh Pandey),
  and a "Who is the founder of MILAN?" FAQ entry.
- Hidden crawlable content and `robots.txt` updated with additional AI crawlers and an `llms.txt` reference.

## 3. Welcome email from support@milanlife.in
- New `backend/services/mailService.js`.
- Sends a premium HTML welcome email on registration (fire-and-forget; registration never fails on mail errors).
- Provider auto-detect (set ONE in env): `RESEND_API_KEY` (recommended on Render), `SENDGRID_API_KEY`,
  or SMTP (`SMTP_HOST/PORT/USER/PASS`, requires the optional `nodemailer` dep).
- If no provider is configured, the email is logged and skipped.
- **Setup:** verify the `milanlife.in` domain with your provider, then set the key + `MAIL_FROM` in env.

## 4. Modern media upload
- New `frontend/milan-modern-upload.js` (loaded in `app.html`).
- Upgrades the file input into a drag-and-drop dropzone with thumbnail preview and a Remove button.
- Reuses the same `#mediaFile` input, so the existing chunked-upload publish flow is unchanged.

## 5. Premium About / Privacy / Terms / Admin pages
- `about.html`, `privacy.html`, `terms.html` rewritten as full, content-rich pages using the sober design system,
  each naming the founder (also reinforces GEO).
- `admin-users.html` rebuilt as a real dashboard: overview stat cards + Users / Activity / Feedback / Security
  tabs (uses `/api/admin/overview`, `/users`, `/activity`, `/feedback`, `/security-reports`), token-gated, CSV export.

## 6. AI for users
- New endpoint `POST /api/ai/assist` (in `backend/routes/ai.js`): Improve / Shorten / Fix grammar / Hashtags / Ideas.
- Prefers Claude (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), then OpenAI/Gemini; rule-based fallback if no key.
- Hinglish/Hindi aware (keeps the user's language).
- Surfaced as inline buttons under the composer textarea (via `milan-modern-upload.js`).

## Environment variables added (see backend/.env.example)
```
MAIL_FROM=MILAN <support@milanlife.in>
RESEND_API_KEY=        # or SENDGRID_API_KEY, or SMTP_* set
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=     # optional: powers AI writing assist + MILAN AI
```

## Notes
- `nodemailer` is in `optionalDependencies`, so `npm install` won't fail if it can't be fetched;
  it's only needed for the SMTP mail path.
- All new code was syntax-checked and the mail/AI/GEO endpoints were smoke-tested in isolation.

## V7.2 — UI overhaul (matches approved mockup) + carries V7.1 perf

New authoritative UI layer recreates the clean slate-dark mockup. Scoped under
`html.milan-v72`, loaded LAST so it wins over every earlier theme. Presentation
only — no app logic, routes, or upload flow changed. The real MILAN logo
(gradient "M") is used in the topbar.

New files:
- `frontend/milan-ui.css` — full restyle: slate-dark canvas, sticky topbar
  with centred pill search + "Filters / Theme / Export" buttons, stacked status
  (Cloud DWN / AI / DWN) on the right, left sidebar nav + profile card +
  System Status, clean Create Post composer, inline AI Assistant styling,
  right rail (Find People / Recent Contacts / Notifications), flat feed cards.
- `frontend/milan-ui.js` — adds the structural bits the mockup needs on top
  of existing markup: the status stack, the avatar dropdown (Usage Stats /
  Admin Panel / Logout), the "View Profile" link, nav icons, and the System
  Status card (kept in sync with the app's own counters). Pure DOM decoration.

Carried forward from V7.1 (still included): `milan-image-worker.js` +
`milan-speed-addon.js` (off-main-thread avatar compression + debounce).

Wiring in `app.html`:
- `<link ... milan-ui.css>` added LAST in `<head>`.
- `milan-speed-addon.js` then `milan-ui.js` added at end of `<body>`
  (`defer`, so order is preserved and overrides land after app scripts).

All new JS syntax-checked; CSS braces balanced.

> Note: because the older themes (Krishna/V2/V4) are still present underneath,
> a few deep components may need minor follow-up tuning once you see it live on
> milanlife.in. The new layer overrides the visible surfaces; if anything looks
> off, it's a targeted CSS tweak, not a rebuild.
